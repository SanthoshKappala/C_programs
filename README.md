## Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SanthoshKappala/C_programs.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired program's directory:

   ```bash
   cd C_programs
   ```

3. Compile the C program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):

   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o outputname
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./outputname
   ```

Replace `filename.c` with the actual file name and `outputname` with your desired output file name.
